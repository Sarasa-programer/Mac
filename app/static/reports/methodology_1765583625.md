# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- The search query was constructed using a combination of keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) terms to capture relevant articles. The query was: `(Child[Title/Abstract]) AND (Age: 2 years[Title/Abstract]) AND (Cardiac Tamponade[Title/Abstract]) AND (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation[Title/Abstract])`.
- Filters applied included:
  - English language restriction
  - Date range limited to the last 5 years
  - Study type filters to include only clinical trials, reviews, and case reports

## 2. Databases
- **PubMed** was used as the primary database for the search, given its comprehensive coverage of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- **Date Range**: The search was limited to articles published within the **last 5 years** to ensure relevance and currency of the information.
- **Language**: The search was restricted to **English** language articles to facilitate easier review and analysis of the results.

## 4. Criteria
- **Inclusion Criteria**:
  - **Clinical Trials**: Studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions related to cardiac tamponade and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a 2-year-old child.
  - **Reviews**: Comprehensive summaries of existing literature on the management and treatment of cardiac tamponade and the role of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in pediatric patients.
  - **Case Reports**: Detailed descriptions of individual cases or small series of cases involving cardiac tamponade and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in children around the age of 2.
- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - **Editorials**: Opinion pieces or commentary articles that do not provide original research or systematic reviews of the literature.
  - **Non-peer reviewed** articles: Articles that have not undergone rigorous peer review, including but not limited to letters to the editor, news articles, and non-academic publications.

## 5. Results
Despite the comprehensive search strategy, **no relevant articles** were found that met the specified inclusion criteria, suggesting a gap in the literature regarding the specific scenario of a 2-year-old child presenting with cardiac tamponade and undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Further research or a broader search strategy may be necessary to identify relevant information or to explore related topics that could inform clinical practice in this area.
