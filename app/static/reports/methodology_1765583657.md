# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The search query was constructed using a combination of keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) terms to capture relevant articles. The query included terms related to the patient's age, condition, and treatment.
- Expanded Search String: `(Child[Title/Abstract]) AND (Age: 2 years[Title/Abstract]) AND (Cardiac Tamponade[Title/Abstract]) AND (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation[Title/Abstract])`
- Filters applied: The search was limited to English language articles and a date range of the last 5 years to ensure relevance and currency of the information.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The search was conducted in PubMed, a comprehensive database of biomedical literature, to capture a wide range of relevant articles.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to articles published in the last 5 years (2018-2022) to ensure that the information retrieved is up-to-date and relevant to current clinical practice.
- Language: The search was limited to English language articles to facilitate ease of understanding and analysis of the results.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search included clinical trials, reviews, and case reports to capture a range of study designs and levels of evidence.
- Exclusion: Editorials, non-peer reviewed articles, and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded from the search results.

## 5. Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy, no relevant articles were found that met the inclusion criteria. The search results did not yield any studies or reports that matched the specific query of a 2-year-old child with cardiac tamponade and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Further searching or consultation with a specialist may be necessary to gather more information on this topic.
