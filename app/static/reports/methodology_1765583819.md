# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The initial query was translated and expanded into a search string using relevant medical terminology: `(Impetigo[Title/Abstract] OR Cellulitis[Title/Abstract]) AND (Tachypnea[Title/Abstract] OR Respiratory Rate[Title/Abstract] = 16/minute) AND (Fever[Title/Abstract] OR Pyrexia[Title/Abstract]) AND (Cough[Title/Abstract] OR Sputum[Title/Abstract])`.
- Filters applied: The search was limited to English language and the last 5 years to focus on recent, relevant studies.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The search was conducted primarily in PubMed, a comprehensive database of biomedical literature, to maximize the retrieval of clinical trials, reviews, and case reports related to the query.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to the last 5 years to ensure that the most current evidence was captured.
- Language: The search was restricted to English to align with the language proficiency of the target audience and to streamline the review process.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search aimed to include clinical trials, reviews, and case reports that discussed the conditions and symptoms outlined in the query.
- Exclusion: Editorials, non-peer reviewed articles, and studies not meeting the specified date range or language criteria were excluded to maintain the rigor and relevance of the search results.

## 5. Results
Despite the systematic approach to constructing the search query and applying specific filters, the search yielded no relevant findings that met the inclusion criteria. This outcome suggests that there may be a gap in the current literature addressing the specific combination of symptoms and conditions outlined in the query, or that the query itself may require further refinement to capture relevant studies.
