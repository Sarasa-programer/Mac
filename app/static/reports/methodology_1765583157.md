# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The initial query utilized the terms "XylophoneReparationTechnique" and "NonExistentDisease123" to capture relevant results. 
- Expanded Search String: To enhance the sensitivity of the search, an expanded search string was developed, incorporating various synonyms and related terms for "Xylophone" and "NonExistentDisease123". The expanded search string is as follows: `(Xylophone[Title/Abstract] OR Xylophone Repair[Title/Abstract] OR Xylophone Maintenance[Title/Abstract] OR Xylophone Restoration[Title/Abstract]) AND (Non-existent disease[Title/Abstract] OR Non-existent condition[Title/Abstract])`.
- Filters applied: No additional filters were applied beyond the specified parameters.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The search was conducted primarily in the PubMed database, a comprehensive source of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to the last 5 years to focus on recent research and findings.
- Language: The search was restricted to English-language publications to ensure consistency and accessibility.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search aimed to include clinical trials, reviews, and case reports, as these study types are most relevant to clinical practice and research.
- Exclusion: Editorials and non-peer-reviewed publications were excluded from the search results, as they may not undergo the same level of rigorous review as included study types.

## 5. Results
Despite the comprehensive search strategy, no relevant findings were identified that met the specified criteria. The absence of results suggests that there is a lack of research or published literature on the topic of "XylophoneReparationTechnique" in relation to "NonExistentDisease123" within the parameters of the search.
