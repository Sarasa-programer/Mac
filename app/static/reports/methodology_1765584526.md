# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The search query was constructed using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords related to the condition of interest. The query included terms for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), age (2 years), symptoms (cough, wheezing, rhinorrhea), disease severity, and respiratory parameters (oxygen saturation, respiratory rate).
- Filters applied: The search was filtered to include only clinical trials, reviews, and case reports, while excluding editorials and non-peer reviewed articles.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The search was conducted in the PubMed database, which is a comprehensive database of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to articles published in the last 5 years to ensure that the results reflect current knowledge and practices.
- Language: The search was limited to articles published in English to facilitate analysis and interpretation of the results.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search included clinical trials, reviews, and case reports to capture a range of study designs and levels of evidence.
- Exclusion: Editorials and non-peer reviewed articles were excluded to ensure that the results are based on rigorous and critically evaluated research.

## 5. Search String
The expanded search string used was: `(RSV[Title/Abstract] OR Respiratory Syncytial Virus[Title/Abstract]) AND (Age[Title/Abstract]: "2 years" OR Age[Title/Abstract]: 2[yr]) AND (Cough[Title/Abstract] OR Wheezing[Title/Abstract] OR Rhinorrhea[Title/Abstract]) AND (Severity[Title/Abstract] OR Disease Severity[Title/Abstract]) AND (Oxygen Saturation[Title/Abstract] OR Oxygen[Title/Abstract] OR Respiratory Rate[Title/Abstract]: 34/min OR Respiratory Rate[Title/Abstract]: 34 breaths/min)`

## 6. Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy and applying relevant filters, the search yielded no findings that met the inclusion criteria. This suggests that there may be a lack of research or published evidence on this specific topic, or that the search terms and filters used may not have been sufficient to capture relevant articles. Further refinement of the search strategy or expansion of the search parameters may be necessary to identify relevant studies.
