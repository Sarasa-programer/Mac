# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The search query was constructed using a combination of keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) terms to capture relevant information. The query included terms related to the patient's symptoms, age, and vital signs.
- Filters applied: The search was filtered to include only English language articles, and the date range was limited to the last 5 years.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The search was conducted using the PubMed database, which is a comprehensive database of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to articles published in the last 5 years to ensure that the results are up-to-date and relevant.
- Language: The search was limited to English language articles to facilitate easier review and analysis of the results.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search included clinical trials, reviews, and case reports to capture a range of study designs and publication types.
- Exclusion: Editorials and non-peer reviewed articles were excluded to ensure that the results are based on high-quality, peer-reviewed evidence.

## 5. Search String
The expanded search string used was: `(Child[Title/Abstract]) AND (Vomiting[Title/Abstract] OR Diarrhea[Title/Abstract]) AND (Fever[Title/Abstract]) AND (Age[Title/Abstract]: 5 years) AND ((Temperature[Title/Abstract]: 37.9) OR (Body Temperature[Title/Abstract]: 37.9)) AND (Respiratory Rate[Title/Abstract]: 16 per minute)`

## 6. Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy, no relevant articles were found that matched the search criteria. This may be due to the specific combination of symptoms and vital signs used in the search query, or the limited date range and language filters applied. Further searching or modification of the search strategy may be necessary to identify relevant articles.
