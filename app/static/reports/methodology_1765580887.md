# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The search query was constructed using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords. The query was designed to capture relevant studies related to tachycardia, respiratory rate, body temperature, and duration of symptoms.
- Filters applied: The search query was filtered to include only studies published in the last 5 years, written in English, and limited to clinical trials, reviews, and case reports.
- Expanded Search String: The search string used was `(Tachycardia[Title/Abstract] OR Tachyarrhythmia[Title/Abstract]) AND (Respiratory Rate[Title/Abstract] = 34/minute) AND (Body Temperature[Title/Abstract] = 37.9°C) AND (Duration[Title/Abstract] = 2 days)`

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The search was conducted primarily on the PubMed database, which is a comprehensive database of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to studies published in the last 5 years to ensure that the results are up-to-date and relevant.
- Language: The search was limited to studies written in English to ensure that the results can be easily understood and interpreted.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search included clinical trials, reviews, and case reports to capture a range of study designs and methodologies.
- Exclusion: The search excluded editorials and non-peer reviewed articles to ensure that the results are based on high-quality, peer-reviewed evidence.

## 5. Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy and applying relevant filters, the search yielded **no findings**. This suggests that there may be a lack of published research on this specific topic, or that the search terms and filters used may not have been sufficient to capture relevant studies. Further refinement of the search strategy or consultation with a subject matter expert may be necessary to identify relevant literature.
