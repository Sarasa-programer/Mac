# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The search query was constructed using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords related to the condition of a 5-year-old child presenting with fever, vomiting, black stool, and an elevated respiratory rate. The query was expanded to include relevant terms such as pediatrics, child, fever, pyrexia, vomiting, body temperature, hyperthermia, black stool, melena, degree of fever, respiratory rate, and tachypnea.
- Filters applied: The search was filtered to include only articles published in the last 5 years, in the English language, and limited to clinical trials, reviews, and case reports.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The search was conducted primarily in the PubMed database, which is a comprehensive database of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to articles published in the last 5 years to ensure that the results are current and relevant.
- Language: The search was limited to articles published in the English language to facilitate easier review and analysis of the results.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search included clinical trials, reviews, and case reports to capture a wide range of study designs and publication types.
- Exclusion: The search excluded editorials and non-peer reviewed articles to ensure that the results are based on high-quality, peer-reviewed evidence.

## 5. Search String
The expanded search string used was: `(Pediatrics[Title/Abstract] OR Child[Title/Abstract]) AND (Fever[Title/Abstract] OR Pyrexia[Title/Abstract]) AND (Vomiting[Title/Abstract]) AND (Body Temperature[Title/Abstract] OR Hyperthermia[Title/Abstract]) AND (Black Stool[Title/Abstract] OR Melena[Title/Abstract]) AND (Degree Of Fever[Title/Abstract]) AND (Respiratory Rate[Title/Abstract] OR Tachypnea[Title/Abstract]) AND (Age[Title/Abstract] : "5 years" OR Age[Title/Abstract] : 5)`

## 6. Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy and applying relevant filters, the search yielded no relevant results. This suggests that there may be a lack of published evidence on this specific topic, or that the search terms and filters used may not have been sufficient to capture all relevant articles. Further refinement of the search strategy and consultation with subject matter experts may be necessary to identify relevant evidence.
