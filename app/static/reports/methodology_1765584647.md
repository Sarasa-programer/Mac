# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The search query was constructed using a combination of keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) terms to capture relevant articles. The query included terms related to the patient's age (2-Year-Old), condition (Typhoid Fever, Fever), symptoms (Allergic Reaction, Anaphylaxis, Respiratory Rate), treatment (Subcutaneous Injection, Subcutaneous Administration), and outcomes (Hospitalization, Vomiting, Emesis).
- Filters applied: The search was filtered to include only articles published in the last 5 years, in the English language, and limited to clinical trials, reviews, and case reports.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The search was conducted using the PubMed database, which is a comprehensive database of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to articles published in the last 5 years to ensure that the results are up-to-date and relevant to current medical practice.
- Language: The search was limited to articles published in the English language to facilitate easier review and analysis of the results.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search included clinical trials, reviews, and case reports to capture a range of study designs and article types that may be relevant to the patient's condition.
- Exclusion: The search excluded editorials and non-peer reviewed articles to ensure that the results are based on high-quality, peer-reviewed evidence.

## 5. Search Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy and applying relevant filters, the search yielded no relevant results. The search query was:

(2-Year-Old[Title/Abstract]) AND (Typhoid Fever[Title/Abstract] OR Fever[Title/Abstract]) AND (Allergic Reaction[Title/Abstract] OR Anaphylaxis[Title/Abstract]) AND (Respiratory Rate[Title/Abstract] = 34 OR Respiratory Rate[Title/Abstract] / Minute) AND (2-Year-Old[Title/Abstract] AND (Subcutaneous Injection[Title/Abstract] OR Subcutaneous Administration[Title/Abstract])) AND (Fever[Title/Abstract] OR Temperature[Title/Abstract] = 379 OR Temperature[Title/Abstract] > 98.6) AND (Allergic Reaction[Title/Abstract] OR Anaphylaxis[Title/Abstract]) AND (Hospitalization[Title/Abstract] OR Inpatient[Title/Abstract]) AND (Vomiting[Title/Abstract] OR Emesis[Title/Abstract])

The lack of relevant results may be due to the specificity of the search query or the limited availability of research on this particular topic. Further searching or consultation with a medical expert may be necessary to inform clinical decision-making.
