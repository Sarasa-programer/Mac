# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The initial query was translated and expanded into a search string to capture relevant terms. The expanded search string utilized MeSH terms and keywords related to the condition, including `(Tachycardia[Title/Abstract] OR Bradycardia[Title/Abstract]) AND (Heart Rate[Title/Abstract] = 160/min OR Respiratory Rate[Title/Abstract] = 16/min) AND (Fever[Title/Abstract] OR Chills[Title/Abstract]) AND (Viral Infection[Title/Abstract] OR Bacterial Infection[Title/Abstract])`.
- Filters applied: The search was limited to English language and the last 5 years to focus on recent, relevant studies.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The primary database searched was PubMed, given its comprehensive coverage of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to the last 5 years to ensure the retrieval of current and relevant information.
- Language: The search was restricted to English language publications to facilitate easier review and analysis of the results.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search aimed to include clinical trials, reviews, and case reports, as these study types provide valuable insights into the diagnosis, treatment, and management of the condition.
- Exclusion: Editorials and non-peer-reviewed articles were excluded from the search, as they may not provide the same level of evidence-based information as included study types.

## 5. Results
Despite the comprehensive search strategy, no relevant findings were retrieved that matched the specified criteria. This may indicate a lack of recent research or publication on the specific topic as defined by the search parameters. Further refinement of the search strategy or expansion of the date range may be necessary to capture relevant information.
