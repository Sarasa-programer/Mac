# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The search query was constructed using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords related to the topic. The query was designed to capture relevant information about a 5-year-old child presenting with fever, vomiting, black stool, and a respiratory rate of 26.
- Filters applied: The search was filtered to include only clinical trials, reviews, and case reports, while excluding editorials and non-peer reviewed articles.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The search was conducted in the PubMed database, which is a comprehensive database of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to articles published in the last 5 years to ensure that the most recent and relevant information was retrieved.
- Language: The search was limited to articles published in English to facilitate easier review and analysis of the results.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search included clinical trials, reviews, and case reports that addressed the topic of a 5-year-old child with fever, vomiting, black stool, and a respiratory rate of 26.
- Exclusion: The search excluded editorials, non-peer reviewed articles, and articles that did not meet the specified inclusion criteria.

## 5. Search String
The expanded search string used was:
`(Pediatrics[Title/Abstract] OR Child[Title/Abstract]) AND (Fever[Title/Abstract] OR Pyrexia[Title/Abstract]) AND (Vomiting[Title/Abstract] OR Emesis[Title/Abstract]) AND (Body Temperature[Title/Abstract] OR Hyperthermia[Title/Abstract]) AND (Black Stool[Title/Abstract] OR Melena[Title/Abstract]) AND (Degree[Title/Abstract] OR Severity[Title/Abstract]) AND (Fever Duration[Title/Abstract] OR Pyrexia Duration[Title/Abstract]) AND (Respiratory Rate[Title/Abstract] OR Respiratory Rate 26[Title/Abstract])`

## 6. Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy and applying relevant filters, the search yielded no relevant results that met the specified inclusion criteria. This suggests that there may be a lack of published research or clinical evidence addressing the specific topic of a 5-year-old child with fever, vomiting, black stool, and a respiratory rate of 26. Further investigation or consultation with a healthcare professional may be necessary to address this clinical scenario.
