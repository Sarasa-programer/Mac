# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
The search query was constructed using a combination of keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) terms to capture relevant articles related to a 2-year-old child with typhoid fever, allergic reaction, and respiratory symptoms. The query was expanded to include various synonyms and related terms to ensure a comprehensive search. The following filters were applied:
- Age: 2 years old
- Conditions: Typhoid fever, allergic reaction, anaphylaxis
- Symptoms: Respiratory rate, minute ventilation, diarrhea, vomiting
- Setting: Hospital admission, bedside

The expanded search string used was: `(2-Year-Old[Title/Abstract]) AND (Typhoid Fever[Title/Abstract] OR Fever[Title/Abstract]) AND (Allergic Reaction[Title/Abstract] OR Anaphylaxis[Title/Abstract]) AND (Respiratory Rate[Title/Abstract] = 34/minute OR Minute Ventilation[Title/Abstract]) AND (Hospital Admission[Title/Abstract] OR Bedside[Title/Abstract]) AND (Morning[Title/Abstract] OR Morning[Title/Abstract]) AND (Diarrhea[Title/Abstract] OR Vomiting[Title/Abstract])`

## 2. Databases
The primary database used for this search was:
- PubMed

## 3. Parameters
The search parameters used were:
- Date Range: Last 5 years
- Language: English

## 4. Criteria
The inclusion and exclusion criteria used for this search were:
- Inclusion: Clinical trials, Reviews, Case Reports
- Exclusion: Editorials, non-peer reviewed articles

## 5. Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy and applying relevant filters, no relevant articles were found that matched the specified criteria. The search results yielded no studies that investigated the specific combination of typhoid fever, allergic reaction, and respiratory symptoms in a 2-year-old child. Further searching or modification of the search strategy may be necessary to locate relevant information.
