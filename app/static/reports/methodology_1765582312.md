# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The original query was in Persian and was translated into English to facilitate the search. The translated query is 'Child music therapy for chest pain in 5-year-old'.
- Expanded Search String: The PubMed search string was generated as `(Child[Title/Abstract] OR Children[Title/Abstract]) AND (Music Therapy[Title/Abstract] OR Music[Title/Abstract] OR Therapy[Title/Abstract]) AND (Chest Pain[Title/Abstract] OR Thoracic Pain[Title/Abstract]) AND (Age[Title/Abstract]: 5 years)`.
- Filters applied: The search was limited to the last 5 years, English language, and specific publication types (clinical trials, reviews, case reports).

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The search was conducted using the PubMed database, which is a comprehensive database of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to the last 5 years to ensure that the results are current and relevant.
- Language: The search was limited to English language publications to facilitate the review process.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search included clinical trials, reviews, and case reports, which are considered high-level evidence for clinical decision-making.
- Exclusion: The search excluded editorials and non-peer reviewed publications, which are considered lower-level evidence.

## 5. Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy, no relevant results were found that match the search criteria. This suggests that there may be a lack of research on the topic of music therapy for chest pain in 5-year-old children, or that the existing research does not meet the specified inclusion criteria. Further searching or alternative search strategies may be necessary to locate relevant information on this topic.
