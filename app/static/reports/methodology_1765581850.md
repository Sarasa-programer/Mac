# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- The query "test query" was constructed and expanded into the search string "search term". No additional filters were applied to the search string to ensure a comprehensive search of the literature.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed was utilized as the primary database for the search, given its extensive coverage of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- The search was limited to the last 5 years to focus on the most recent evidence.
- The language was restricted to English to facilitate easier review and analysis of the results.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion criteria consisted of clinical trials, reviews, and case reports, as these study types are considered high levels of evidence for clinical practice.
- Exclusion criteria included editorials and non-peer reviewed articles, as they do not undergo the same rigorous review process as included study types.

## 5. Results
Despite the comprehensive search strategy, no relevant findings were identified that met the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search methodology was designed to capture a broad range of relevant literature, but the lack of results suggests that there may be a gap in the current evidence base for the topic in question. Further investigation or a revised search strategy may be necessary to locate relevant information.
