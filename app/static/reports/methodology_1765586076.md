# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The search query was constructed using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords related to the condition described. The query included terms for fever, vomiting, dehydration, and age-specific filters for a 2-year-old child. The query also included filters for frequency and tachycardia.
- Filters applied: The search query included filters for title/abstract, age, and frequency to narrow down the search results to relevant studies.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The search was conducted on the PubMed database, which is a comprehensive database of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to the last 5 years to ensure that the most recent and relevant studies were included.
- Language: The search was limited to English language studies to ensure that the results could be easily interpreted.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search included clinical trials, reviews, and case reports to capture a range of study designs and levels of evidence.
- Exclusion: Editorials and non-peer reviewed articles were excluded to ensure that only high-quality, peer-reviewed studies were included.

## 5. Search Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy, no relevant studies were found that matched the search criteria. The search query was:
`(Fever[Title/Abstract] OR Pyrexia[Title/Abstract]) AND (Vomiting[Title/Abstract] OR Nausea[Title/Abstract]) AND (Dehydration[Title/Abstract] OR Hypovolemia[Title/Abstract]) AND (Child[Title/Abstract] AND Age: 2 years[Filter]) AND (Frequency: 32 times per minute[Filter] OR Tachycardia[Title/Abstract])`

The lack of findings may be due to the specificity of the search criteria or the limited availability of studies on this topic. Further searching or consultation with a healthcare professional may be necessary to find relevant information.
