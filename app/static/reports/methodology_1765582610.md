# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The search query was constructed using a combination of relevant keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) terms to capture the concept of Kawasaki Disease in pediatric populations. 
- Expanded Search String: `(Kawasaki Disease[Title/Abstract] OR Kawasaki Syndrome[Title/Abstract]) AND (Child[Title/Abstract] OR Infant[Title/Abstract] OR Adolescent[Title/Abstract])`
- Filters applied: The search was limited to English language and the last 5 years to focus on recent and relevant studies.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The primary database searched was PubMed, a comprehensive database of biomedical literature.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to the last 5 years (2018-2023) to capture the most recent research and findings.
- Language: The search was limited to English language to focus on studies published in a widely spoken language.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search included clinical trials, reviews, and case reports to capture a range of study designs and levels of evidence.
- Exclusion: The search excluded editorials and non-peer reviewed articles to focus on high-quality, peer-reviewed research.

## 5. Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy, no relevant findings were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The search results did not yield any studies that investigated Kawasaki Disease in pediatric populations within the specified date range and language. Further searching or modification of the search strategy may be necessary to identify relevant studies.
