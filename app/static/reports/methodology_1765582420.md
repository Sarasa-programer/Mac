# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
- Query construction: The search query was constructed using a combination of relevant keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) terms to capture the concept of Kawasaki Disease in pediatric populations. The query included terms for Kawasaki Disease and its synonyms, as well as terms for children, infants, and adolescents.
- Expanded Search String: `(Kawasaki Disease[Title/Abstract] OR Kawasaki Syndrome[Title/Abstract]) AND (Child[Title/Abstract] OR Infant[Title/Abstract] OR Adolescent[Title/Abstract])`
- Filters applied: The search was limited to English language and the last 5 years to focus on recent and relevant studies.

## 2. Databases
- PubMed (Primary): The search was conducted in PubMed, a comprehensive database of biomedical literature, to capture a wide range of studies related to Kawasaki Disease in pediatric populations.

## 3. Parameters
- Date Range: The search was limited to the last 5 years (2018-2022) to focus on recent studies and advancements in the field.
- Language: The search was limited to English language to ensure that the results are relevant and accessible to the target audience.

## 4. Criteria
- Inclusion: The search included clinical trials, reviews, and case reports to capture a range of study designs and levels of evidence.
- Exclusion: The search excluded editorials, non-peer reviewed articles, and other publication types that may not provide high-quality evidence.

## 5. Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy and applying relevant filters, the search yielded no findings that met the inclusion criteria. This suggests that there may be a lack of recent, high-quality evidence on Kawasaki Disease in pediatric populations, or that the search terms and parameters used may not have been sufficient to capture relevant studies. Further refinement of the search strategy or expansion of the search parameters may be necessary to identify relevant studies.
