# Search Methodology Document
## 1. Strategy
The search strategy involved constructing a query that captured the key elements of the clinical presentation, including:
- Age: 5 years old
- Symptoms: Fever, diarrhea, vomiting
- Vital signs: Body temperature (37.9°C), respiratory rate (16 breaths per minute)
The query was expanded to include relevant MeSH terms and limits to ensure a comprehensive search. The expanded search string used was: `(Child[Title/Abstract] AND Age: 5[Limit] AND Fever[Title/Abstract] AND Diarrhea[Title/Abstract] AND Vomiting[Title/Abstract] AND Body Temperature: 37.9[Limit] AND Respiratory Rate: 16[Limit])`.

## 2. Databases
The primary database used for this search was:
- PubMed

## 3. Parameters
The search parameters applied were:
- Date Range: Last 5 years
- Language: English

## 4. Criteria
The inclusion and exclusion criteria used for this search were:
- Inclusion: Clinical trials, Reviews, Case Reports
- Exclusion: Editorials, non-peer reviewed

## 5. Results
Despite using a comprehensive search strategy and applying relevant filters, no relevant findings were retrieved from the search. The search results yielded no studies that matched the specified criteria, indicating a potential gap in the literature or the need for further investigation into this specific clinical presentation. 

## 6. Limitations
The limitations of this search include:
- The search was limited to a single database (PubMed)
- The search was restricted to English language articles
- The search was limited to the last 5 years, which may not capture relevant older studies

## 7. Future Directions
Future searches could consider:
- Expanding the search to include other databases, such as Embase or Scopus
- Including non-English language articles
- Broadening the date range to capture older studies
- Using alternative search terms or MeSH headings to capture relevant articles.
